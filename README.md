A git view for [herdr](https://herdr.dev). Changed files on one side, a
syntax-highlighted diff on the other. Press `Enter` and the diff pane
*becomes* your real nvim - opened at the first changed line. You never leave
the terminal.

Inspired by [herdr-reviewr](https://github.com/persiyanov/herdr-reviewr),
rebuilt around a real editor - edit diffs in place with full nvim + LSP
support, not just view them.

## Features

- **Grouped changes** - conflicts, staged, and unstaged changes in separate
  sections. `s` moves a file between staged and unstaged.

- **Readable diffs** - syntax highlighting, word-level emphasis on edited
  lines, and collapsible context folds you expand with a click.
- **Edit in real nvim** - `Enter` turns the diff pane into your actual nvim:
  full LSP, plugins, colors. Edit the file right there at the changed line,
  `:wq`, and the diff refreshes. No embedded-terminal emulation - it runs on
  the pane's own PTY.

- **Stage, discard, commit inline** - the commit message opens in nvim too;
  discards confirm first. `s`/`u`/`x` work on a directory row too, applying to
  every file under it in that section.
- **Commit history** - `l` opens a `git log` view; pick a commit to browse its
  files and per-commit diffs. `w` filters it to just the commits your branch
  added on top of its base (and opening the log from branch scope starts
  there). `m` reads the selected commit's full message - subject, author, date
  and body - in the wide pane, where a real message actually fits.
- **Knows what your branch was cut from** - branch scope diffs against the
  branch you actually branched off, so a branch stacked on another feature
  branch shows only its own work instead of both.
- **Review notes to any agent** - select diff lines, annotate, and send the
  batch into the input of any agent pane you pick in the workspace. It types;
  you decide when to press enter. You write a note inline in the diff, in a
  box under the lines it comments on, and it stays there as a card once
  saved. The composer is a wrapping text area: `shift+enter` (or `ctrl+j`)
  for a new line, arrows/`home`/`end` to move around, `ctrl+w` to drop a
  word, `esc` to cancel.

- **Always says which diff you are looking at** - the header names the
  comparison first, before the branch: `uncommitted · feat/x` or
  `vs origin/next · feat/x · 3 commits`. The diff pane says the same thing,
  and the footer's `w` hint names the view it switches to. On a narrow pane
  the file counts go before the comparison does.
- **Mouse support** - click to select, double-click to open, drag-select diff
  lines, wheel to scroll, click folds to expand.

## Requirements

- **herdr ≥ 0.7.0** (≥ **0.7.4** for the native floating dialogs; older
  versions fall back to in-pane overlays).
- **git** on `PATH`.
- **nvim** for the editor loop (any editor works via config; the
  remote-control niceties - file switching, save/discard prompts - are
  nvim-only).
- A truecolor terminal. Pick the `theme` matching its background
  ([Theme](#theme)).
- macOS or Linux.

## Install

Prebuilt binaries, no Rust toolchain needed:

```bash
herdr plugin install ChmaraX/herdr-gitview
```

Bind a key in `~/.config/herdr/config.toml` (`cmd+g` is free of herdr's
defaults; any key works):

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "cmd+shift+g"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "chmarax.gitview.toggle"   # sidebar in the current tab
description = "git view sidebar"

[[keys.command]]
key = "cmd+g"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "chmarax.gitview.toggle-tab"   # dedicated gitview tab
description = "git view tab"
```

`toggle` opens a sidebar in the tab you're in (each tab can have its own);
press again in that tab to close. `toggle-tab` opens one dedicated tab per
repo and jumps to it if it's already open.

**To update**, reinstall - your config survives:

```bash
herdr plugin uninstall chmarax.gitview && herdr plugin install ChmaraX/herdr-gitview
```

**Without herdr**, the file list runs as a plain terminal app in any repo -
browse, stage, unstage, discard:

```bash
herdr-gitview list
```

Editing, commits, history diffs, and notes need the second pane, i.e. herdr.

## Quick start

1. **Open it.** `cmd+g` in any repo. Changed files on the right, the
   selected file's diff on the left.
2. **Browse.** `j`/`k` (or the wheel) - the diff follows your cursor.
   `Tab`-free: selecting a file under *staged changes* shows its staged diff,
   under *changes* the unstaged one.
3. **Edit.** `Enter` - nvim opens in the diff pane at the first changed line.
   `:wq`, and you're back on the refreshed diff, focus on the list.
4. **Stage & commit.** `s` to stage (the file moves up), `x` to discard
   (asks first), `c` to commit - write the message in nvim, `:wq` commits,
   `:q!` aborts. On a directory row the same keys apply to the whole folder.
5. **See what your branch did.** `w` switches the file list to "vs the base
   branch"; `l` then opens the log already filtered to your branch's commits
   (`w` toggles that filter in the log view too).
6. **Review for your agent.** Focus the diff pane, `v` + `j`/`k` (or drag) to
   select lines, `a` to annotate - a box opens right under the selection,
   type and `enter`. Notes stay as cards under the code. `p` → pick an agent
   → the batch lands in its input.

The footer in each pane shows only the keys that currently work, so you learn
it by using it.

## Branch scope

`w` switches the file list from the working tree to "everything this branch
changed". The base it compares against is **the branch this one was created
from**, not a fixed trunk: a branch cut from `develop` diffs against
`develop`, and a branch stacked on another feature branch diffs against that
branch. The header names it, e.g. `nv-2-ui  vs nv-1-api`.

It works by ancestry, not by naming: every other branch is ranked by how
recently your branch diverged from it, and the nearest one wins. Ties between
siblings cut from the same commit go to the trunk. On a trunk itself there is
nothing to be cut from, so the usual `origin/HEAD` → `origin/main` →
`origin/master` → `main` → `master` chain applies.

One case it can get wrong: a branch created *from yours* also has a recent
divergence point. Branches containing all of your commits are ignored, which
covers the usual shape, but if the guess is ever wrong, pin it:

```toml
base = "origin/main"
```

## Configuration

`$HERDR_PLUGIN_CONFIG_DIR/config.toml`, usually
`~/.config/herdr/plugins/config/chmarax.gitview/config.toml`. Every key is
optional; [assets/example-config.toml](assets/example-config.toml) shows all
defaults, commented.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `theme` | `"dark"` | `"dark"` or `"light"` - syntax theme + all UI tints |
| `editor` | `["nvim"]` | Editor argv; the file (and `+<line>`) is appended |
| `base` | `""` | Branch-scope base ref; `""` detects the branch this one was cut from (see [Branch scope](#branch-scope)) |
| `list_side` | `"right"` | `"right"` or `"left"` |
| `view_width_percent` | `50` | Sidebar mode: how much of the tab gitview takes; your existing panes get the rest (20–80) |
| `list_width_percent` | `25` | How much of the gitview area the file list takes (10–80) |
| `default_scope` | `"worktree"` | `"worktree"` or `"branch"` - which scope the view opens in |
| `context_lines` | `3` | Unchanged lines kept around each change before folding (0–20) |
| `poll_ms` | `2000` | Auto-refresh interval in ms; `0` disables, non-zero floored at 250 |
| `show_untracked` | `true` | Include untracked files |

### Theme

`theme = "dark"` pairs a dark syntax palette with dark red/green diff tints;
`"light"` is GitHub-web-flavored. Match your terminal's background - diff
tints are painted as real background colors.

### Keybindings

`[keybindings]` maps action names to keys. An override replaces all default
keys for that action; binding a key another action owns is reported at
startup and the table is ignored until fixed.

```toml
[keybindings]
stage = "space"
discard = "ctrl+x"
```

Grammar: `[ctrl+][alt+][shift+]<key>` where `<key>` is a single character or
`enter`, `esc`, `tab`, `space`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `pgup`,
`pgdn`, `home`, `end`. Action names: `down up top bottom edit stage unstage
discard commit log annotate select send_notes notes_view delete toggle_scope
toggle_cached toggle_thread commit_message refresh help quit half_page_down
half_page_up diff_top diff_bottom scroll_down scroll_up`.

## Limitations

- **Editing needs herdr** - standalone `herdr-gitview list` covers browsing
  and staging only.
- **Remote editor tricks need nvim** (`--listen`/`--server`). Other editors
  work for plain editing; you close them yourself.
- **Notes live in memory** - closing the view discards unsent notes.
- **Notes attach to working-tree changes** - you can't annotate historical
  commits.
- Native floating dialogs need herdr ≥ 0.7.4; older versions get in-pane
  overlays.

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChmaraX/herdr-gitview
cd herdr-gitview
cargo build --release
herdr plugin link "$PWD"
```

`cargo test` runs the full suite - parser units, fixture git repos, and
ratatui render tests. `just release-dry` mirrors CI (fmt, clippy, tests,
release build). `GITVIEW_DEBUG=1` writes a debug log to the plugin state dir.
